Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```bash
    git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```
Branch name could be anything preferably related to your name or issue.

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
    git pull origin main
```

<h3>5.Make changes and commit them</h3>
  Make the necessary changes on your local computer and save the file.

  Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

  ```bash
    git add <file name>
```
or
```bash
    git add --all
```


Commit those changes using `git commit` command:
```bash
    git commit -m "message about what you have done"
```
<h3>6. Push changes to github</h3>

```bash
    git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
`<add-your-branch-name>`  name of the branch you created earlier.

<h3>7.Submit your changes</h3>

Once you push the changes to your repo, the `Compare & pull request`button will appear in GitHub.Click it and you will be taken to another screen.Then click `Create pull request` button.
