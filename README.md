    git add --all
```


Commit those changes using `git commit` command:
```bash
    git commit -m "message about what you have done"
```
<h3>6. Push changes to github</h3>

```bash
    git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
`<add-your-branch-name>`  name of the branch you created earlier.

<h3>7.Submit your changes</h3>

Once you push the changes to your repo, the `Compare & pull request`button will appear in GitHub.Click it and you will be taken to another screen.Then click `Create pull request` button.
